* incremental backup
  + backup part
	+ recovery part


Think about:
* record modification time of all backed-up files in a file along with the backup. That will
  allow us to restore such files when strange things had happen. Example : I have restored some
	files from a given date and now, I want return with the most recent files.
* validate each files with checksum (or hash)
* schedulding
* compression ?
* remote backup ?
* encryption ?
* transaction ?
* GUI or curses ? (for the restoring part ?)
