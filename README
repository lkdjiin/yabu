==OVERVIEW
"Yeah! Another Backup Utility" (Yabu in short) is a backup and recovery utility
for linux.
It maybe works for other systems but I don't know.
Yabu is written in ruby, so you need a ruby interpreter to run it.

==INSTALL
Put all the files somewhere in your PATH.

==BEFORE RUNNING
Yabu is in it's development stage. Try it, hack it, learn from
it, but DON'T USE IT right now in a production environment.
To try Yabu, just edit directories.conf and yabu.conf.
But before doing that you really should check the documentation.
See the wiki on GitHub : https://github.com/lkdjiin/yabu/wiki.
You can find user guides (may be not up to date) in english and french at this
address : http://sources.xavier.free.fr/ruby.php#yabu

==RUNNING
Type yabu.rb from a terminal to start saving your data.
Type yabu.rb --help to view a list of options.
Recovery is not yet implemented.

==HACKING
You can found developper's documentation in doc/.
If the YARD gem is installed on your computer, run makedoc.sh to be sure the doc
is up to date.
Begin by reading the Yabu class.
